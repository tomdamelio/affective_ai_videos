S13_3P_EndP:
Photorealistic, 3rd Person perspective, floor-level view. A 20-year-old Male bare right foot with a natural five-toe structure is pressed completely flat against a beige tiled floor, bearing full body weight. The foot has stepped directly onto a sharp object which is hidden underneath the sole and not visible. Instead, a small, dark pool of fresh blood is seeping out from under the arch of the foot where the puncture occurred, staining the grout lines. The muscles of the foot and ankle are tensed and rigid, indicating the immediate reaction to stepping on the spike. Cinematic lighting, 8k, raw style.

S32_3P_EndP:
Photorealistic, 3rd Person perspective. A 20-year-old Female bare right foot with five distinct and well-defined toes is resting delicately on a bed of real, hot glowing charcoal embers and ash. The focus is on a more realistic, early-stage thermal injury: The sole of the foot is intensely red and inflamed (severe erythema) where it touches the heat source. Instead of large grotesque blisters, there are smaller, developing blisters beginning to rise on the heel and ball of the foot. The skin looks raw, shiny, and painful from the heat, but not charred black or heavily peeled. The glow from the realistic embers illuminates the damaged skin. Cinematic lighting, 8k, raw style, documentary realism.
